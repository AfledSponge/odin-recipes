    <p>Pancakes are probably everyone's favorite breakfast dish. You don't know how to make them though. Unfortunately, neither do I! For this recipe, I will simply list the directions on the back of a premade pancake mix box, but add my own twist!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Pearl Milling Company Pancake Mix</li>
        <li>2 Cups of Chocolate Chips</li>
        <li>Cocoa Powder</li>
        <li>Powdered Sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now that you've got your ingredients ready, it is time to make Fisher's Chocolate Chocolate Chip Pancakes, or as I like to call them, Biden Cakes!</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Make your pancake batter following the instuctions on the box</li>
        <li>Add cocoa powder while mixing until the batter becomes a nice light chocolately brown color</li>
        <li>Add your chocolate chips</li>
        <li>Pour about 1/4 a cup of the mix onto a pan on medium head. Flip when bubbles stop appearing on the top. Repeat until no more batter remains.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle powdered sugar on top of the pancakes, and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
